# Classical-Computer-Science-Problems-in-Python

# This is a repo for the notes and code of me working through the book 
# Classical Computer Science Problems in Python by David Kopec.
# In the book, the code is mainly done in separate .py files.
# I have converted much of them as Jupyter Notebooks for easy reading and review.

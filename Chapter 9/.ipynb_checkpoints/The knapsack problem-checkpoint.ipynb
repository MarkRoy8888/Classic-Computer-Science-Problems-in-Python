Therefore, the algorithm performs in O(N * C) time, a significant improvement over the brute-force approach for a large number of items. For instance, for the 11 items that follow, a brute-force algorithm would need to examine 2^11 or 2,048 combinations. The preceding dynamic programming function will execute 825 times, because the maximum capacity of the knapsack in question is 75 arbitrary units (11 * 75). This difference would grow exponentially with more items.\"\n",

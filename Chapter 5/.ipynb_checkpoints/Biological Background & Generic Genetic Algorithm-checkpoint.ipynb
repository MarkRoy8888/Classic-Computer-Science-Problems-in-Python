    " - \"A genetic algorithm includes a population (group) of individuals known as _chromosomes_. The chromosomes, each composed of genes that specify their traits, are competing to solve some problem. How well a chromosome solves a problem is defined by a _fitness function_.\n",
    " \n",
    " - \"The genetic algorithm goes through _generations_. In each generation, the chromosomes that are more fit are more likely to be _selected_ to reproduce. There is also a probability in each generation that two chromosomes will have their genes merged. This is known as _crossover_. And finally, there is the important possibility in each generation that a gene in a chromosome may _mutate_ (randomly changed).\n",

    " 3. Implement crossover - combine with another of the same type to produce children.\n",

    "\" The maximizing player aims to find the move that will lead to maximal gains. However, the maximizing player must account for moves by the minimizing player. After each attempt to maximize the gains of the maximizing player, minima is called recursively to find the opponent's reply that minimizes the maximizing player's gains. THis continues back and forth (maximizing, minimizing, and so on) until a base case in the recursive function is reached. The base case is a terminal position (a win or a draw) or a maximal search depth. The base case is a terminal position (a win or a draw) or a maximal search depth.\"\n",

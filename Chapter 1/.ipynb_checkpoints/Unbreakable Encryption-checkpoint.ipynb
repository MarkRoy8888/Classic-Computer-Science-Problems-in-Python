    "Encrypting data using a one time pad. \"A one-time pad is a way of encrypting a piece of data by combining it with meaningless random dummy data in such a way that the original cannot be reconstituted without access to both the product and the dummy data. In essence, this leaves the encrypter with a key pair. One key is the product, and the other is the random dummy data. One key on its own is useless; only the combination of both keys can unlock the original data. When performed correctly, a one-time pad is a form of unbreakable encryption.\"\n",

In our case, it does not matter as long as we use the same ordering both when we encrypt and decrypt, because we are actually only manipulating the data at the individual bit level. In other situations, when you are not controlling both ends of the encoding process, the ordering can absolutely matter, so be careful! "

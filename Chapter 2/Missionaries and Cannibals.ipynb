    "\"Three missionaries and three cannibals are on the west bank of a river. They have a canoe that can hold two people, and they all must cross to the east bank of the river. There may never be more cannibals than missionaries on either side of the river, or the cannibals will eat the missionaries. Further, the canoe must have at least one person on board to cross the river. What sequence of crossings will successfully take the entire party across the river?\""
